# SimpleRESTfulAPI
Simple REST API with elasticsearch 
This is my first example of RESTful API integrated with elasticsearch database.
it covers the basic operations CRUD on one table.
Read operation is to be performed on the elasticsearch database.
the rest Create Update Delete are to be performed on the SQL database.
Observer service is a back ground service running to capture any changes performed on the SQL data to reflect these changes on the elastic view cache data
